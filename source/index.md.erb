## Our Goal

A platform for creating virtual reality scenes using tools web developers are experienced with.

## An introduction

Create scenes using **html like markup** and css:

```xml
<scene>
  <box id="mycube" position="1 2 3" scale="1 1 1" style="color: #f07" />
</scene>
```

**Add interaction** to these scenes using **javascript**:

```javascript
document.getElementById("mycube").addEventListener("click", function(e){
  document.scene.removeChild(document.getElementById("mycube"));
});
```

Play with friends with **multiplayer support** that is automatically enabled.

```javascript
var playerCount = 0;

document.getElementById("mycube").addEventListener("click", function(e){
  playerCount++;
  console.log(e.player.name + " just clicked the cube");
  console.log(playerCount + " players have clicked the cube");
});
```

**Live edit scenes** in your favourite text editor and see changes in realtime. **Edit any file**, and when you hit save, the server will reload the changes and everyone viewing the scene will see the changes instantly. **Work collaboratively**. Make changes on your PC and share to your friends in realtime over the net.

```
$ scenevr myscenes/
[server] Serving scenes in 'myscenes/' on port 8080...
[server] Restarting server on file change.
```

**Get started in minutes**

Install node.js for your platform (Windows, Linux or Mac) and then simply use npm to install the scene server in less than a minute.

```
$ npm install -g scenevr
```

With SceneVR you can build multiuser 3d scenes using html-like tags and javascript. SceneVR scenes are viewed using a browser-powered viewer (powered by webGL). Chrome, firefox and IE are supported. The server is powered by node.js and runs on Windows, Mac OS and Linux.

# Feature comparison

SceneVR can be used to create multiplayer 3d scenes in a similair way to Unity or Second Life. SceneVR is way younger than either of these projects, so SceneVR isn't as powerful, but there are some things that SceneVR does well.

<p class="feature-comparison" />

Feature | SL | Unity | SceneVR
--------|------|---------|--------
Simple html-like markup | - | - | ✓
Javascript scripting support | - | ✓ | ✓
Physics model | ✓ | ✓ | ✓
Baked in multiplayer | ✓ | - | ✓
HTML Billboards | ✓ | - | ✓
Runs in your browser | - | ✓ | ✓
Opensource licence | - | - | ✓
Free to develop and host | - | - | ✓
.OBJ model support | - | ✓ | ✓
Live reload support | ✓ | - | ✓
Mobile support | - | ✓ | ✓

Unity is much more fully featured than SceneVR, but with each release SceneVR becomes more capable, and the fact that all scenes have baked-in multiplayer support is a strong advantage, plus the fact that you don't need to learn the Unity IDE, you can just develop using your current modelling tools and text editor.

There are another two projects that use similair markup to SceneVR, [JanusVR](//janusvr.com) and [GLAM](//glamjs.org).

# Features

## Rift support

[JanusVR](//janusvr.com/) is a fully featured 3d web browser that supports SceneVR. It has excellent oculus rift support. Develop your content in the web client, then launch Janus to experience your scene in the rift!

## Multi-user

Your SceneVR scene is multi-user from the get go. Just share the URL to your scene and your friends can join you. Each user is represented by a peg-man character. When a user interacts with the scene (by clicking a button for example), everyone sees the change that happens to the scene. You can use this to write **multi-user games** using just xml and javascript.

## Javascript API

Script your scene with a **simple javascript API** that is modelled on the DOM. The javascript code is run on the server, and changes are reflected to all connected clients. You can change element attributes, create elements, remove elements.

## Mobile device support

Your scenes work in modern webGL-enabled browsers like the ios 8 browser. Just turn your phone sideways, and use the two thumb joysticks to walk and look around the scene.

## Interpolation

Changes on the server are sent to the clients 5 times a second. On the frames in between, movement and rotation are interpolated, so your clients get a 60 (or 75) fps **silky smooth** experience.

## Simple markup

The markup is straightforward and easy to learn. Use style attributes for styling, linear gradients on your skybox. Rotations are expressed in euler angles as radians (so `rotation="3.14 0 0"` rotates an element 180° around the x axis.) Positions are expressed in meters so `position="0 0 10"` is 10 meters in front of you.

## .obj model support

Use the model tag (`<model src="/models/cat.obj" />`) to import obj models from your favourite modelling tool. You can also apply textures (that are normal shaded) or lightmaps (that are unlit) to your models.

## Physics simulation

We use [cannon.js](http://cannonjs.org/) so do collision detection on the client, so you can create platform games where you jump from box to box. We have a blender plugin under development to export collision models from that tool.
