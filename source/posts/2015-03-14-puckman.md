I deployed puckman today, it's based on [pacman.js](https://github.com/daleharvey/pacman) by @daleharvey. It was pretty easy to convert to SceneVR.

I first iterated over the pacman.map variable, and create a box for every wall in the map. Each box has a large dark blue box, and a small bright blue border around it. I then create all the little pills, which are set to `collision-response: false` which means that the script can detect touching them up, but walk straight through them. Then the ghosts are instantiated and simulated 10 times a second by the pacman.js code.

Then it's a simple case of adding a `<model />` for each ghost (pacman.js tells you what color to make them, pink or green etc, or blue when they're vulnerable, or grey when they're dead), and looking for collision events with the ghosts and killing the player, or eating the ghost.
