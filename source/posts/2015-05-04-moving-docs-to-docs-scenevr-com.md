title: Moving docs to docs.scenevr.com

<div class="md"><p>The client.scenevr.com/?connect URL is needlessly complex, I&#39;m going to put the scenevr world at <a href="http://www.scenevr.com">www.scenevr.com</a>, and move the docs and blog to docs.scenevr.com.</p>

<p>So now whenever someone goes to check out scenevr, they&#39;ll be launched straight into virtual reality, instead of having to click the &#39;try now&#39; link.</p>

<p>This is also part of an effort to put more focus on VR in scenevr, so instead of having lots of web components, try and move as much into VR as possible. For example, the face configurator that I was working on, that&#39;s being redeveloped as a VR scene, instead of a seperate web page.</p>

<p>The UI is also going to undergo a bit of a redesign to make mobile and clients using VR (cardboard / rift) more of a first class citizen in the world, at the moment the VR experience works best for the pc master race, and I want everyone to be included.</p>

<p>Except for console (unless someone with a console development license wants to port the unity client to xbox / ps). :)</p>
