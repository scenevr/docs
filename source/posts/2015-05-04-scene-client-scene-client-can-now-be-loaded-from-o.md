<div class="md"><p>I just published the scene-client 1.0.2. This is part of my goal to make SceneVR work so that you can include scenes on your own websites, by just including a script tag and a bit of javascript. This release.</p>

<p>Similair to the way the google maps api lets people embed maps on their own site the scene client will eventually be usable so you can have scenes embedded on your site.</p>

<p>There will probably be some limitations to this initially, like you will be anonymous, and if you enter a portal that takes you elsewhere on the internet, you&#39;ll be redirected to the full scenevr client (as scenevr.com), but it&#39;ll be a great way for putting your content on your own server.</p>

<p>This is all part of upgrading scenevr.com with the new server i&#39;m working on, that interoperates with the rest of the internet a lot better, and makes Scene less of an island and more a part of the web.</p>
