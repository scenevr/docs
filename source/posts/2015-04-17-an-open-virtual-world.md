I didn't start SceneVR because I wanted to build the eponymous virtual world.

I built it because I want there to be an opensource, open natured virtual world, that everyone can contribute to and be in. I don't want a hundred different virtual worlds that don't interoperate. I want to be able to walk from one room to another room, scene to scene, world to world, without leaving your browser or client.

## JanusVR

James and I have been talking for a while. During a chat last week, we got to understand each other a bit better, and I mocked up a proxy that allowed Janus to connect to SceneVR worlds. After that demo, James blew my mind by adding support for Scene markup to Janus.

The thing with Janus, is that James invented most of this shit.

* Portals. James invented them.
* Rooms with html-like markup. James invented that.
* A white floor with a grid on it and a skybox in the distance? Well, the matrix invented that, but James reintroduced it to the conscience. ;)

## Altspace and Convrge

Altspace and Convrge are doing awesome stuff in the VR space. They have nice clients and altspace has a javascript API coming out.

But they're all seperate worlds.

What is the point of making a bunch of worlds that don't interoperate?

I really want us to work together to make it so you can walk from one world to another. That doesn't mean that I want everyone to build their worlds in Scene, but I really want is to make a way that you can walk straight from Janus to Scene to Altspace to Convrge.

Let's make it happen.
