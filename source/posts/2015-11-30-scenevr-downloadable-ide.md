<div class="md"><p>Hi all, long time no post! I&#39;ve been working on a downloadable version of SceneVR that has an installer and is a quick and easy way to let you start building Scenes, without having to install npm or understand how node.js works.</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/a0BUlMT.png">This is how the editor looks</a>.</p>

<p>I&#39;m working out the last few bugs today and hope to get it released. It will make it much much easier to create scenes on your own computer, and the installer also acts as a server, so people on your own LAN can connect to your server and walk around the scenes as you edit them.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve also added google cardboard support to the client, so you can use your phone to load scenes.</p>
