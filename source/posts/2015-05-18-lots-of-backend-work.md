<div class="md"><p>You might not have noticed a bunch of changes on the front of SceneVR lately, but we haven&#39;t been idle. We&#39;ve been making a new frontend that can be indexed by google, so that your scenes get good search engine ranking, and when you paste a link to your scene, reddit, twitter and facebook (and anyone else that uses opengraph tags) can display a thumbnail of your scene to encourage people to try out your scene.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve also been working on a large change to make it so that you can develop scenes in the browser without requiring a node.js server. Hopefully you&#39;ll start to see some of this come to fruition soon!</p>
