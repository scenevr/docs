I finished up a multiplayer version of chess tonight. It uses [chess.js](https://github.com/jhlywa/chess.js/) to handle the logic, and implements the interactivity and multiplayer using scenevr.  [Try it out!](http://client.scenevr.com/?connect=chess.scenevr.hosting/chess.xml) You can see the [source code](http://chess.scenevr.hosting/chess.xml), it is about 180 lines of javascript.

It's been fantastic watching people play the game. Currently anyone can play, but what tends to happen is that people cluster at the viewing platform at each end, and one person jumps down and makes a move. It's a pretty fun emergent behaviour watching people play. There are a few bugs (castling, promotion doesn't work) that need fixing, I've added [issues for them on github](http://github.com/scenevr/chess/issues), if anyone wanted to have a crack at them that'd be awesome, but otherwise it's looking pretty good.
