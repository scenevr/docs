The scene server is a node.js app and requires npm to install dependencies. You'll need to install [node](//nodejs.org) and [npm](//npmjs.org) to get started. Scene server has been tested on Windows and OS X.

# Getting Started 

## Installing

    npm install -g scenevr

This will take a little while while the npm dependencies are downloaded. The `scenevr` executable will then be installed globally.

## Download sample scenes

Download the sample scenes.

    git clone https://github.com/scenevr/samples

Start the server:

    scenevr ./samples/

## Launch the webclient

Open the webclient and load the files served from your localhost:

&raquo; Open [client.scenevr.com](http://client.scenevr.com/?connect=localhost:8080/index.xml) for local files

## Host your finished scenes

Once you have your scenes working well locally, host them for everyone to see at:

&raquo; [SceneVR hosting](//scenevr.hosting)

Hosting is free for creative commons licensed content.

## Promote your scenes

Post your scene (the url to view the scene in client.scenevr.com) to [/r/scenevr](//reddit.com/r/scenevr) and we will add a link to them from the home room.
