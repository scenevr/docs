# Events

These events are listed in Pacific Time (GMT-8), but you are welcome to attend from anywhere in the world, because all events take place in Virtual Reality!

Use [everytimezone](http://everytimezone.com/) to work out when an event is occurring in your time zone.

Most events start in the [homeroom](http://client.scenevr.com/). You should [log in](http://login.scenevr.com/) with SceneVR before joining the event, so that you can voice chat with everyone. There is no need to RSVP for events.
